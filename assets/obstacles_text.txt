"Cannon" has 3 main type of obstacles:
1. Stone bricks - they are a foundation of a stone wall we can see starting from level. They can be destroyed by any projectile.
2. Perpetio - this is a wall that can't be destroyed.
3. Mirror - it can't be destroyed as well, but it reflects lasers, which is convenient in the last level.
